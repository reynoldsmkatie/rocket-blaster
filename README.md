### Description:
I really enjoyed creating my last 10-second game, so I created another, called "Rocket Blaster," using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Rocket Blaster focuses heavily on CSS animations and uses JavaScript functions to control: 1.) an image switch depending whether a toggle is set to true or false, 2.) a gradual color and height change that manually changes RGB values and pixel heights with each click, and 3.) a choice of six post-game animations, one of which will play dependent on your score.

### Game Synopsis:
You have 10 seconds to pump as much fuel as you can into a rocket. When time runs out, see how far your rocket flies across the galaxy!
